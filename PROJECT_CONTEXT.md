# Game Sandbox Project Context

## Project Structure

This is a multiplayer game built with:
- **Server**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io
- **Client**: Phaser 3, HTML/CSS/JavaScript

The project follows a modular architecture where:
1. Server-side code in `/src/server/` handles game state, physics, and networking
2. Client-side code in `/public/` handles rendering, input, and game objects

## Recent Improvements

### 1. Server Refactoring
- Split monolithic server code into modules for better maintainability
- Created separate managers for players, projectiles, and physics
- Enhanced game loop with proper delta time handling

### 2. Client Refactoring
- Implemented proper class-based architecture
- Created separate entity classes (Player, VisibleProjectile)
- Improved UI management and input handling
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 3. Fixed Networking Issues
- Synchronized projectile positions between server and clients
- Added missing velocity data to game state updates
- Improved collision detection and handling

## Key Components

### Server
- `server.js`: Main server entry point, sets up Express and Socket.io
- `game.js`: Core game logic and event handling
- `players.js`: Player management, creation, updates
- `projectiles.js`: Projectile management, creation, physics
- `physics.js`: Physics calculations and collision detection
- `config.js`: Game constants and settings

### Client
- `index.html`: Main HTML entry point
- `js/scenes/MainScene.js`: Primary game scene with logic
- `js/entities/Player.js`: Player entity class
- `js/entities/VisibleProjectile.js`: Projectile entity with visuals
- `js/managers/AnimationManager.js`: Animation creation and handling
- `js/networking/SocketManager.js`: Socket.io communication
- `js/ui/UserInterface.js`: UI components and management

## Current State

The game currently supports:
- Multiple players connecting and playing simultaneously
- Character movement with animations
- Projectile shooting with proper visuals
- Sword combat mechanics
- Health and ammo management
- Player names and UI

## Next Steps

1. Performance optimization:
   - Implement spatial partitioning for better scaling
   - Add delta compression for network traffic
   - Optimize render pipeline

2. Gameplay improvements:
   - Add different weapon types
   - Implement power-ups and collectibles
   - Add game modes and objectives

3. Infrastructure:
   - Add automated testing
   - Create a CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement server scaling mechanisms

## Upcoming Tasks

- Optimize collisions for large player counts
- Add more visual effects and feedback
- Improve game balance and mechanics
- Enhance the player experience with sound and visuals
