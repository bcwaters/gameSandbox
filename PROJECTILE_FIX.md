# Projectile System Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistent Collision Detection**
   - Different collision radii between client (16px) and server (20px)
   - Led to "phantom hits" where visuals didn't match collision detection

2. **Self-Collision Problems**
   - Inadequate offset distance for projectile spawning
   - Players could hit themselves when moving quickly or changing directions

3. **Duplicate Hit Processing**
   - Both client and server could detect and process the same hit
   - Could lead to multiple hit effects or double damage

4. **Projectile Lifecycle Management**
   - Inconsistent destruction logic between client and server
   - Missing error handling in projectile destruction code
   - No validation for defeated player states

5. **Inefficient Collision Detection**
   - No optimization for collision checks at scale
   - Potential for performance issues with many projectiles/players

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Standardized Collision Parameters
- Unified collision radius to 16px on both client and server
- Improved hit detection accuracy by using the same collision metrics everywhere

### 2. Enhanced Self-Collision Protection
- Increased projectile spawn offset from 30px to 40px
- Added defeated state checks to prevent firing while defeated
- Improved validation in collision handlers

### 3. Improved Hit Detection Logic
- Added active sprite checks before processing collisions
- Enhanced error handling in projectile destruction
- Added defeated state validation to prevent hits on defeated players

### 4. Better Projectile Lifecycle Management
- Added try/catch blocks around projectile destruction
- Implemented fallback cleanup methods if primary destruction fails
- Added visual and audio feedback for projectile impacts

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Added delta time clamping to prevent large position jumps during lag
- Implemented processed projectile tracking to prevent duplicate processing
- Added bounds check buffer to ensure proper cleanup of off-screen projectiles

### 6. Enhanced Feedback
- Added impact visual effects at collision points
- Ensured hit sounds play consistently
- Improved console logging for debugging collision events

## Testing

To verify the fixes work correctly:
1. Launch the game with multiple players
2. Test projectile collisions with players and obstacles
3. Verify that projectiles don't hit their owner
4. Check that defeated players can't be hit again
5. Verify that projectiles properly despawn when out of bounds

## Future Improvements
- Implement spatial partitioning for more efficient collision detection
- Add projectile types with different visual and behavior characteristics
- Create a more sophisticated reconciliation system between client and server
