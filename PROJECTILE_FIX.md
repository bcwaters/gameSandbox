# Projectile Visibility Fix

## Issue
Projectiles were not visually tracking with their collision boxes. The game objects themselves were moving and colliding properly, but they were invisible to players.

## Root Causes
1. Conflicting asset loading - projectiles were loaded both as spritesheets and regular images
2. Improper collision box offsets that didn't match the visual sprite
3. Potential issues with animation frames and sprite rendering

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Asset Loading
- Loaded the projectile as both a spritesheet and a simple image with different keys
- Created a fallback mechanism to ensure projectiles are always visible

### 2. Enhanced Projectile Class
- Fixed the sprite scale and position to properly display projectiles
- Added a rotation animation for better visual feedback
- Added red tinting to make projectiles more visible
- Adjusted collision box size and offset to match the sprite

### 3. Added Fallback Mechanism
- Created a SimpleProjectile class that uses basic graphics primitives
- This ensures projectiles remain visible even if sprite assets fail to load
- The SimpleProjectile generates its own texture, making it independent of external assets

### 4. Improved Collision Handling
- Enhanced error handling in collision detection
- Added clear visual feedback when projectiles hit players
- Added logging to help diagnose any remaining issues

### 5. Visual Effects
- Added a hit impact effect when projectiles collide with players
- Made projectiles spin for better visibility
- Added color tinting to make projectiles easier to see

## Testing
To verify the fix is working:
1. Launch the game with `npm start`
2. Connect multiple players
3. Fire projectiles with the spacebar
4. Verify projectiles are visible and tracking with their collisions
5. Check that hit detection works correctly

## Future Improvements
- Add particle effects for projectile trails
- Implement different projectile types with distinct visuals
- Add sound effects that match projectile impacts
