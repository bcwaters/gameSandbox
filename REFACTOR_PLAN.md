# Game Sandbox Refactoring Plan

## Current Issues

1. **Code Organization**
   - All server-side code is in a single large file
   - Client code is mixed in HTML with minimal modularization
   - No separation of concerns between game logic, networking, etc.

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Full game state sent to all clients on each update
   - No server-side optimization for handling many players
   - Inefficient collision detection
   - No spatial partitioning for player interactions

3. **Architecture Issues**
   - Tight coupling between client and server
   - No clear separation between game state and rendering
   - No validation of client inputs
   - Inconsistent error handling

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Code Organization

1. **Server-side Restructuring**
   - Split server.js into modular components:
     - `src/server/server.js` - Main server setup
     - `src/server/game.js` - Core game logic
     - `src/server/physics.js` - Physics and collision system
     - `src/server/players.js` - Player management
     - `src/server/projectiles.js` - Projectile handling
     - `src/server/config.js` - Game constants and configuration

2. **Client-side Restructuring**
   - Move inline JavaScript to separate files:
     - `public/js/game.js` - Main game initialization
     - `public/js/scenes/MainScene.js` - Main game scene
     - `public/js/entities/Player.js` - Player class
     - `public/js/entities/Projectile.js` - Projectile class
     - `public/js/ui/UserInterface.js` - UI elements
     - `public/js/networking/SocketManager.js` - Socket communication

### Phase 2: Performance Optimizations

1. **Network Optimization**
   - Implement delta compression (only send changes)
   - Add spatial partitioning to limit updates to relevant players
   - Optimize payload size by reducing unnecessary data

2. **Physics Optimization**
   - Implement a quadtree or grid-based spatial partitioning
   - Optimize collision detection to avoid O(nÂ²) complexity
   - Add prediction and interpolation for smoother client experience

3. **Server Processing**
   - Implement worker threads for parallel processing
   - Optimize the game loop for better CPU utilization
   - Add load balancing capabilities for future scaling

### Phase 3: Architecture Improvements

1. **State Management**
   - Create a proper game state management system
   - Implement client-side prediction and server reconciliation
   - Add validation for all client inputs

2. **Error Handling**
   - Add consistent error handling and logging
   - Implement recovery mechanisms for disconnects
   - Add monitoring capabilities

3. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for core game functionality
   - Implement automated integration tests
   - Add load testing for multi-player scenarios

### Phase 4: Scalability

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Refactor for multi-server support
   - Implement sharding for game worlds
   - Add message queuing for inter-server communication

2. **Database Integration**
   - Add persistence for player stats and game state
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add authentication system

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with a development branch for experimental changes
2. Implement changes incrementally, starting with code organization
3. Add automated tests alongside each major change
4. Regularly test with multiple clients to verify scaling improvements
5. Document architectural decisions and patterns
